This code is a modified version of [HIDKeys.2007-03-29][1] that can type
"Hello, world". It is the same code that is used on my YouTube video [USB
Keyboard using ATmega8][2].

I wrote this as a hack, as a proof-of-concept, just to see if it would work.

If you want to start playing with ATmega8 or AVR microcontrollers, take a look
at my blog: [First contact with ATmega8 microcontroller][3]
